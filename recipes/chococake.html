Try it today to see what all the fuss is about!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Two cups of white sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness, while locking in the moisture from the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour provides structure, acts as a thickening agent, and helps build the fluffy texture.</li>
        <li>Of course, you'll want to use Hershey's brand unsweetened cocoa powder for this one. It adds the rich, indulgent flavor you know and love.</li>
        <li>Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners, which means they cause the batter to expand and give the cake a perfect rise.</li>
        <li>Just a teaspoon of salt is all you'll need to add complexity and highlight the other flavors. It might not seem like a lot, but you'll definitely miss the salt if you skip it.</li>
        <li>Whole eggs affect the cake in a number of ways: They provide structure, add moisture, lend flavor, and contribute to a tender texture.</li>
        <li>Whole milk adds moisture and helps the batter come together smoothly.</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil ensures your cake will never be dry.</li>
        <li>Two teaspoons of vanilla extract add complex flavor and bring out the flavors of the other ingredients, such as the cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>You might be wondering why this recipe calls for a cup of boiling water. It intensifies the chocolatey flavor, contributes to the fluffy texture, and reacts with the leaveners to create an even higher rise.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>Make cake: Stir together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl</li>
        <li>Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla; mix for 3 minutes with an electric mixer. Stir in boiling water by hand.</li>
        <li>Pour evenly into the prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to cool completely.</li>
        <li>While cakes cool, make frosting: Cream butter with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Stir in confectioners' sugar and cocoa alternately with milk and vanilla. Beat to a smooth spreading consistency.</li>
        <li>Split the layers of the cooled cake horizontally, cover the top of each layer with frosting, then stack them onto a serving plate.</li>
        <li>Frost the outside of the cake with remaining frosting.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
